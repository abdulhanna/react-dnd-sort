You can make custom  draggable item  by adding customComponent in SortableList.

  const [data,setData] = useState([
    {
      id: 1,
      text: 'Write a cool JS library',
      title:"this is Library titile"
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      text: 'Make it generic enough',
      title:"this is Library titile"
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      text: 'Write README',
      title:"this is Library titile"
    },
    {
      id: 4,
      text: 'Create some examples',
      title:"this is Library titile"
    }, {
            id: 5,
            text: 'Spam in Twitter and IRC to promote it (note that this element is taller than the others)',
            title:"this is Library titile"
          },
          {
            id: 6,
            text: '???',
            title:"this is Library titile"
          },
          {
            id: 7,
            text: 'PROFIT',
            title:"this is Library titile"
          }
  ])

const CustomListItem = (props)=>{
  const {item} = props
    // console.log(props,'props')
  return(<>

    <p className='text-green-500'>{item.text}</p>
    <p className='text-green-600'>{item.title}</p>
  </>)
}

  <SortableList customComponent={CustomListItem} data={data} handleMove={handleMove}/>

```
